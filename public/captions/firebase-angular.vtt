Welcome to From Zero to Firebase: A Hands-On Guide for 2025 Angular Projects.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today we'll build a complete Angular application with Firebase integration.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Firebase provides backend services without managing server infrastructure.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Let's start by creating a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Enable Firestore database and configure security rules for your application.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Install Angular Fire library to connect your Angular app with Firebase.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Configure Firebase credentials in your environment files.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Initialize Firebase modules in your app.module.ts file.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Create your first service to interact with Firestore database.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Implement CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete documents.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Firestore uses collections and documents to organize your data.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Real-time updates make your application responsive and dynamic.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Subscribe to Firestore observables to get live data updates.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Authentication setup allows users to sign in and manage their data.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Enable Google, email, and other authentication providers in Firebase.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Secure your Firestore rules based on user authentication status.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
File storage with Firebase Storage for images and documents.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Deploy your Angular application using Firebase Hosting.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
That's a complete Firebase integration with Angular for 2025!
