Welcome to our comprehensive guide on JDBC CRUD operations in Spring Boot.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today we'll build a complete Maven project with database operations.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity and it's fundamental for data access.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Let's start by setting up our Spring Boot Maven project structure.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Add the necessary dependencies: spring-boot-starter-jdbc and your database driver.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Configure your database connection properties in application.properties.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Create your entity class to represent the database table structure.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Now let's implement the CREATE operation using JdbcTemplate.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
The INSERT statement allows us to add new records to the database.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Next, we'll implement the READ operation to fetch data from the database.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Use SELECT queries with row mappers to convert results to Java objects.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
The UPDATE operation modifies existing records based on specific conditions.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Always include a WHERE clause to avoid updating all records accidentally.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Finally, the DELETE operation removes records from the database.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Be careful with DELETE statements and always test with small datasets first.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Error handling and transaction management are crucial for robust applications.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Use try-catch blocks and consider using @Transactional annotations.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
That completes our JDBC CRUD operations tutorial in Spring Boot!
