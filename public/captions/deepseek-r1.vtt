Welcome to today's podcast on setting up DeepSeek R1 locally with Ollama.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm excited to show you how to build your own AI web reconnaissance tool in just 10 minutes.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
DeepSeek R1 is a powerful reasoning model that can help with cybersecurity tasks.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
First, let's understand what makes DeepSeek R1 special for reconnaissance work.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
The model excels at analyzing web structures and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
To get started, you'll need to install Ollama on your local machine.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Head over to ollama.ai and download the installer for your operating system.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Once Ollama is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Run the command: ollama pull deepseek-r1 to download the model.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
This might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
While it's downloading, let's set up our web reconnaissance tool structure.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Create a new directory called ai-recon-tool and navigate into it.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
We'll need to install some Python dependencies for web scraping and analysis.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Install requests, beautifulsoup4, and the ollama Python library.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Now let's write our first reconnaissance script using DeepSeek R1.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
The script will analyze website headers and identify security configurations.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
DeepSeek R1's reasoning capabilities make it perfect for this task.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
That's the basic setup! Check out the full article for the complete code examples.
