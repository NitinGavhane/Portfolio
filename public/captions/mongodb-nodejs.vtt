Hello and welcome to our deep dive into MongoDB and Node.js interview questions.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today we'll cover the most important topics that appear in coding interviews.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Let's start with MongoDB fundamentals and essential query operations.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
First question: What's the difference between find and findOne methods?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Find returns a cursor with all matching documents, while findOne returns just one.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Next, let's discuss indexing strategies for optimal query performance.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Compound indexes can significantly improve queries on multiple fields.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Now moving to Node.js - explain the event loop and its importance.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
The event loop handles asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Here's a common question: How do you handle errors in async/await functions?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Always use try-catch blocks to properly handle promise rejections.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Let's talk about MongoDB aggregation pipelines and their use cases.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Aggregation is powerful for data transformation and complex queries.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
In Node.js, explain middleware in Express and how it works.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Middleware functions execute during the request-response cycle.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Finally, discuss connection pooling in MongoDB and why it matters.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Connection pooling improves performance by reusing database connections.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
These concepts will help you ace your next MongoDB and Node.js interview!
