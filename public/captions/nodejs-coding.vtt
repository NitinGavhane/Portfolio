Welcome to Node.js Coding Round Success - your guide to interview preparation.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
I'll share the most critical questions and solutions for backend development interviews.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Let's begin with asynchronous programming patterns in Node.js.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Understanding callbacks, promises, and async/await is absolutely essential.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Here's a key question: How would you implement a rate limiter middleware?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Rate limiting prevents API abuse and ensures fair resource usage.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Next topic: file system operations and stream processing in Node.js.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Streams are crucial for handling large files without memory overflow.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Let's discuss clustering and how to scale Node.js applications.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
The cluster module allows you to create child processes for better performance.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Error handling strategies are another common interview topic.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Proper error handling prevents application crashes and improves reliability.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Security considerations in Node.js applications are critically important.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Input validation, authentication, and authorization must be implemented correctly.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Performance optimization techniques can set you apart from other candidates.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Memory management, caching strategies, and database optimization are key areas.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Testing methodologies using Jest, Mocha, or other frameworks are essential.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for your applications.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
These concepts will give you confidence in any Node.js coding interview!
